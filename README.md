# 🏥 Machine Learning for Health Analytics: Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project predicts diabetes risk using UK Health Survey data (2005–2019) and applies machine learning models to uncover key health predictors.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To build a predictive model for early detection of diabetes based on health and lifestyle factors using historical NHS datasets. The project aims to assist in proactive healthcare decisions.

## 💾 Dataset

- UK Health Survey (2005–2012)
- Features include BMI, age, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, and more.
- Cleaned and balanced versions of the data are provided.

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (Python, pandas)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, AUC

## 🧠 Key Outcomes

- Best model accuracy: **87%**
- Identified key features linked to diabetes risk (e.g., BMI, age, alcohol, smoking)
- Balanced dataset improved prediction performance and reduced bias
